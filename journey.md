Chapter 1: Setup
- `go mod init github.com/dbrucknr/go-design-patterns`
- `mkdir cmd`
- `mkdir cmd/web` - this is a convention in Go for projects that serve web pages
    - If you create an API it goes in the `cmd/api` directory.
- `touch cmd/web/main.go` - Here we will create a simple web server using the net/http package.
- Adding a routing package: [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
  - Install command: `go get -u github.com/go-chi/chi/v5`
- Lets add a routes.go file to define our routes
- We will also take advantage of another Chi package to handle middleware.
- Run: go mod tidy to eliminate warning
- Lets begin to think about templates
- mkdir templates
- touch templates/base.layout.gohtml
